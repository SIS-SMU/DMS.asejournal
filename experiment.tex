In this section we present empirical evaluation that analyzes the impact of \textsc{Dms} on manual effort needed for test case labeling, and compares our approach with multiple previous test case prioritization methods.

In particular, our seek for answers to the following two research questions:

%\subsection{Research Questions}\label{sec.exp.rqs}

\begin{enumerate}[RQ1]
\item What is the effectiveness of \textsc{Dms} on single-fault programs?
\item What is the effectiveness of \textsc{Dms} on multi-fault programs?
\end{enumerate}

Section~\ref{sec.rq1} shows our experimental results that answer the first research question. Section~\ref{sec.rq2} presents answers to the second research question. Section~\ref{sec.exp.threats} describe the discussion and some threats to validity.
