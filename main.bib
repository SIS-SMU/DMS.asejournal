  Abstract                 = {Unlike test generation techniques, spectrum-based fault localization techniques have not been rigorously evaluated for their effectiveness in localizing different classes of faults. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of the Tarantula fault localization technique. We state that the following three properties of a fault affect the effectiveness of localizing it: (1) accessibility, (2) original state failure condition, and (3) impact. Accessibility refers to how easy or hard it is to execute a faulty statement. It is measured by the size of the backward slice of the faulty statement. The original state failure condition is the condition that must be satisfied to create a local failure state upon executing the faulty statement. Impact refers to the fraction of the program that is affected by the execution of the faulty statement, measured by the size of the forward slice of the faulty statement. The results of our evaluation with the Siemens benchmark suite show that (1) original state failure condition based fault classes have no relationship with the effectiveness of localization, and (2) faults that are hard to access and have low impact are most effectively localized. These observations are consistent across random and branch coverage based test suites.},

In this paper, we investigate the impact of using richer program profiles such as path profiles on the effectiveness of bug isolation. We describe a statistical debugging tool called Holmes that isolates bugs by finding paths that correlate with failure. We also present an adaptive version of Holmes that uses iterative, bug-directed profiling to lower execution time and space overheads. We evaluate Holmes using programs from the SIR benchmark suite and some large real world applications. Our results indicate that path profiles can help isolate bugs more precisely by providing more information about the context in which bugs occur. Moreover, bug-directed profiling can efficiently isolate bugs with low overheads, providing a scalable and accurate alternative to sparse random sampling.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a value profile based approach for ranking program statements according to their likelihood of being faulty. The key idea is to see which program statements exercised during a failing run use values that can be altered so that the execution instead produces correct output. Our approach is effective in locating statements that are either faulty or directly linked to a faulty statement. We present experimental results showing the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Our approach outperforms Tarantula which, to our knowledge, is the most effective prior approach for statement ranking based fault localization using the benchmark programs we studied.},

  Abstract                 = {Debugging refers to the laborious process of finding causes of program failures. Often, such failures are introduced when a program undergoes changes and evolves from a stable version to a new, modified version. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for debugging evolving programs. Given two programs (a reference, stable program and a new, modified program) and an input that fails on the modified program, our approach uses concrete as well as symbolic execution to synthesize new inputs that differ marginally from the failing input in their control flow behavior. A comparison of the execution traces of the failing input and the new inputs provides critical clues to the root-cause of the failure. A notable feature of our approach is that it handles hard-to-explain bugs like code missing errors by pointing to the relevant code in the reference program. We have implemented our approach in a tool called DARWIN. We have conducted experiments with several real-life case studies, including real-world web servers and the libPNG library for manipulating PNG images. Our experience from these experiments points to the efficacy of DARWIN in pinpointing bugs. Moreover, while localizing a given observable error, the new inputs synthesized by DARWIN can reveal other undiscovered errors. },

Often, such failures are introduced when a program undergoes changes and evolves from a stable version to a new, modified version. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for debugging evolving programs. Given two programs (a reference, stable program and a new, modified program) and an input that fails on the modified program, our approach uses concrete as well as symbolic execution to synthesize new inputs that differ marginally from the failing input in their control flow behavior. A comparison of the execution traces of the failing input and the new inputs provides critical clues to the root-cause of the failure. A notable feature of our approach is that it handles hard-to-explain bugs like code missing errors by pointing to the relevant code in the reference program. We have implemented our approach in a tool called DARWIN. We have conducted experiments with several real-life case studies, including real-world web servers and the libPNG library for manipulating PNG images. Our experience from these experiments points to the efficacy of DARWIN in pinpointing bugs. Moreover, while localizing a given observable error, the new inputs synthesized by DARWIN can reveal other undiscovered errors. },

  Abstract                 = {Typically debugging begins when during a program execution a point is reached at which an obviously incorrect value is observed. A general and powerful approach to automated debugging can be based upon identifying modifications to the program state that will bring the execution to a successful conclusion. However, searching for arbitrary changes to the program state is difficult due to the extremely large search space. In this paper we demonstrate that by forcibly switching a predicate's outcome at runtime and altering the control flow, the program state can not only be inexpensively modified, but in addition it is often possible to bring the program execution to a successful completion (i.e., program produces the desired output). By examining the switched predicate, also called the critical predicate, the cause of the bug can then be identified. Since the outcome of a branch can only be either true or false, the number of modified states resulting by predicate switching is far less than those possible through arbitrary state changes. Thus, it is possible to automatically search through modified states to find one that leads to the correct output. We have developed an implementation based upon dynamic instrumentation to perform this search through program re-execution -- the program is executed from the beginning and a predicate's outcome is switched to produce the desired change in control flow. To evaluate our approach, we tried our technique on several reported bugs for a number of UNIX utility programs. Our technique was found to be practical (i.e., acceptable in time taken) and effective (i.e., we were able to automatically identify critical predicates). Moreover we show that bidirectional dynamic slices of critical predicates capture the faulty code.},
